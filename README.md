# Lessons4JavaSE

## General Information (基本信息)
Here are the source codes of "Java SE Programming" lesson.

"Java SE Programming" is for sophomore in School of Software Engineering of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. 

Most codes come from the textbook "Introduction to Java Programming", which is written by [Dianiel L Yang](http://www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/)

Untill now, I have not learned the license illustration about these codes, especially from above textbook or the author's website.

I hope I can use these source codes legally for educational purpose, particularly putting these codes on github.

If anybody finds that the above actions violate his/her copyright, please notify me and I will delete the related materials as soon as possible.
